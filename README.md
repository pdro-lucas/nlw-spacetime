# ðŸš€ NLW Spacetime Project - Memory Recall
The NLW Spacetime project is an innovative application developed during the Next Level Week event by Rocketseat. It is an interactive platform for memory recall, designed to help users capture and organize significant moments in their lives.

The application allows users to add texts, photos, and videos to a timeline, organizing them by month and year. In this way, it serves as a digital repository of memorable moments, allowing users to revisit their memories in an organized and intuitive way.

This project was developed using the latest web development technologies and follows industry best practices. It represents a collaborative effort by developers participating in the NLW event, combining practical learning with the creation of a useful and relevant product.

With the NLW Spacetime project, we aim to create a solution that allows people to connect with their memories in a new and exciting way. We invite you to explore our code, contribute, and be part of this exciting development journey!
